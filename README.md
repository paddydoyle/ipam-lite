# ipam\_lite

Simple IPAM reporting tool

## Purpose

This is a very simple IPAM (IP Address Management) reporting tool, which looks
at DNS, DHCP and Arpwatch data. It produces a report of IP -> DHCP mappings,
and includes info from arpwatch on when the MAC was last seen.

Some basic mismatch and parsing errors are reported.

It is mainly a reporting tool for when DNS and DHCP information has diverged
over time, and for giving an overall IP/DNS report for a given subnet.

It is assumed that the DHCP entries are fixed-address hosts; i.e. clients pick
up addresses via DHCP, but the entries are fixed and not from a pool.

It does not:

* operate a full IPAM system, with a managed database populating DNS and DHCP
* perform any editing or fixing of issues

## Operational notes

* DNS entries are either:
  - parsed from a file which was generated by dumping BIND-style entries (see
    examples below)
  - OR looked up dynamically using `socket.gethostbyname()` and
    `socket.gethostbyaddr()`.
* DHCP entries are statically parsed from a `dhcpd.conf` file.
* Arpwatch entries are statically parsed from a `arp.dat` file.

## Report

It highlights some basic errors which might creep into a non-IPAM-managed setup:

* mismatch between IP -> hostname -> IP mappings (incorrect forward/reverse RRs
  in DNS)
* malformed MAC address in DHCP
* hostnames in DHCP which don't resolve
* only display IP addresses for which there are no ARP entries (good for looking
  for old defunct entries)
* only display IP addresses for which the ARP entries are older than a given number
  (good for looking for old defunct entries)

It can also print a compressed report of unassigned IP addresses in the range.

## Usage

    $ ./ipam_lite.py -h
    usage: ipam_lite.py [-h] [-v] [-d] [-e] [-u] [-n] [-N NO_ARP_DAYS] [-r]
                        netaddress netmask domain arp_file dhcp_file dns_file

    positional arguments:
      netaddress            IPv4 network address
      netmask               IPv4 network mask, in CIDR 'slash' notation
      domain                default DNS domain name for hosts
      arp_file              the arp.dat file from arpwatch (typically
                            /var/lib/arpwatch/arp.dat)
      dhcp_file             the dhcpd.conf file (typically /etc/dhcpd/dhcpd.conf)
      dns_file              the dumped DNS entries (for example dumped from
                            'named-compilezone -f raw -F text'), forward and
                            reverse zones in a single file
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
      -d, --dhcp_hostnames  check for hostnames in DHCP which don't resolve
      -e, --errors          display parsing and resolution errors
      -u, --unassigned      only display lists of unassigned/free IP addresses
      -n, --no_arp          only display list of IP addresses with no ARP entries
      -N NO_ARP_DAYS, --no_arp_days NO_ARP_DAYS
                            only display list of IP addresses with no ARP entries
                            in the last N days
      -r, --resolve         look up hostnames on the fly, intead of reading
                            entries from a dumped file; ignore 'dns_file' in this
                            case

## DNS File Parsing

If using the `dns_file` parameter (and not the `-r` flag), the entries in the
file should be of the form:

    machine1.foo.com.                        1800 IN A         10.20.112.113
    113.112.20.10.in-addr.arpa.              1800 IN PTR       machine1.foo.com.

That is, it should be a single file containing a dump of forward zones
(`foo.com.`) and reverse zones (`112.20.10.in-addr.arpa.`).

Only `PTR` and `A` records are parsed; other RR types are ignored.

If using BIND, the files can be dumped from a server which stores zones in
the raw binary format using something like:

    named-compilezone -f raw -F text -o /tmp/db.112.20.10.txt 112.20.10.in-addr.arpa db.112.20.10
    named-compilezone -f raw -F text -o /tmp/db.foo.com.txt foo.com db.foo.com
    cat /tmp/db.112.20.10.txt /tmp/db.foo.com.txt > /tmp/db.ALL.txt

Similarly, if using BIND and storing zones in the text format:

    named-compilezone -f text -F text -o /tmp/db.112.20.10.txt 112.20.10.in-addr.arpa db.112.20.10
    named-compilezone -f text -F text -o /tmp/db.foo.com.txt foo.com db.foo.com
    cat /tmp/db.112.20.10.txt /tmp/db.foo.com.txt > /tmp/db.ALL.txt


## TODO

* highlight mismatch between MAC address in DHCP and last reported MAC in
  Arpwatch
* make the Arpwatch parts of the report optional
* IPv6 support
